# Faerie-Food-Restaurant
Hello!  This is my attempt at creating a single page restaurant landing page. 

<!--  Important info !-->
 Thank you for @bedimcode for the basic template.
 
 Technologies used to create this site, HTML, CSS, Javascript.
 
 
 ** Features**
 This site is mobile-friendly and has light-dark mode incorporated into it.  
 
 A scroll Reveal library and image slider library are some of the main features I learned about while doing this project.  
 
 The menu links function but are setup to load practice links on the Stripe Payment network.
